## Hi there, I'm Berke ðŸ‘‹

:telescope:
I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at Sabanci University. Besides, I am also balancing an internship on iOS Development.

:iphone:
With my internship, I am planning to explore and expand my knowledge for `Swift` and `SwiftUI` programming. I also share my simple iOS apps through GitHub so that they may benefit anyone who is eager to learn.

:arrow_right:
Other than iOS, you can find my other projects as well! For instance, check out the [Devstore e-commerce application](https://github.com/berketuranlioglu/devstore_project) coded by me and my friends with Flutter!

## :mega: Contact me
You can reach me anytime.
